#Stable Diffusion Model
  This repository contains the implementation of a Stable Diffusion Model incorporating various sampling methods, including zero-shot      sampling and denoising sampling. The model is designed to generate high-quality images through diffusion processes.
  
  Features
  Zero-Shot Sampling: Enables the model to generate images without prior training on specific tasks.
  Denoising Sampling: Enhances the modelâ€™s ability to handle noisy data and improve image generation quality.
  Installation
  Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
  
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stable-diffusion-model.git
  cd stable-diffusion-model
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  Usage
  To generate images with zero-shot sampling:
  
  python main.py --sampling_method zero_shot
  
  To generate images with denoising sampling:
  
  python main.py --sampling_method denoising
  
  Results
  The model generates high-quality images, providing valuable insights into the capabilities of diffusion processes in image synthesis.
