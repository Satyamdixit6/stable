#Stable Diffusion Model
  This repository contains the implementation of a Stable Diffusion Model incorporating various sampling methods, including zero-shot      sampling and denoising sampling. The model is designed to generate high-quality images through diffusion processes.
  
  Features
  Zero-Shot Sampling: Enables the model to generate images without prior training on specific tasks.
  Denoising Sampling: Enhances the model’s ability to handle noisy data and improve image generation quality.
  Installation
  Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
  
  docker push satyamdixit6666/diffusion-model
  
  Usage
  This API provides image generation capabilities. For detailed documentation, please visit http://localhost:5000/docs⁠. Important Considerations GPU Compatibility: Ensure      GPU compatibility before building, as this is a multi-stage build process. CUDA Note: This image does not include CUDA. If you need CUDA support, please modify the build     process accordingly. Troubleshooting If the container exits with code 132, indicating an out-of-memory error: For GPU-based systems, ensure at least 8 GB of GPU memory is    available. If issues persist, try running on a CPU-based system with at least 12 GB of RAM. Alternatively, when deploying as a pod, set the resource request to 8 GB.
